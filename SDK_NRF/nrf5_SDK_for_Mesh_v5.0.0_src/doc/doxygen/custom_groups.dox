 *
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_APP_SUPPORT Application support modules
 * Application support modules designed to abstract complexity of common tasks in the user code.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_APP_CONFIG Application configuration
 * Application-specific configuration file for mesh resource requirements and parameters.
 *
 * The application configuration file provides a set of defines that controls the application
 * specific parameters of the mesh framework, like company ID, element count and mesh flash area
 * sizes.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_MODELS Mesh Models
 * Mesh models implemented by Nordic Semiconductor.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_ACCESS Access
 * The Access layer provides access to the Core Mesh for Mesh models.
 *
 * @defgroup DEVICE_STATE_MANAGER Device State Manager
 *
 * The Device State Manager provides a means for storing and retrieving Bluetooth Mesh state during operation.
 * It handles:
 * - Address storage - both for subscription and publishing.
 * - Network key management - Generate and store network security material for mesh rx and tx, as
 *   well as beacon and connectable advertisements.
 * - Application key management - Generate and store application security material for mesh rx and
 *   tx.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_CORE   Core
 * Core mesh modules, implementing mesh message passing.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_FRIEND   Friend role
 * Mesh modules that implement the Friend feature.
 *
 * The APIs for the Friend role are used internally by the mesh stack.
 * The Friend feature for the application can be enabled by setting 
 * @ref MESH_FEATURE_FRIEND_ENABLED define to 1.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_BEARER Bearer
 * Bearer-layer module, providing a Bluetooth communication medium for the mesh.
 *
 * The bearer layer is used by the core mesh, provisioning and DFU to communicate with other
 * devices in the mesh network. It contains a generic implementation of the Bluetooth advertiser
 * and scanner roles, with an extended HCI-based interface. Advertisers may be instantiated by the
 * user to implement non-mesh related features like beaconing, but direct interaction with the
 * bearer layer is not necessary to operate the mesh.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_DFU    DFU
 * Device firmware upgrade module for the mesh
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_PROV   Provisioning
 * Device provisioning module for the mesh.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_SERIAL Serial
 * Serialization of the mesh API.
 * For a full reference of the available mesh serial commands and events, see the @ref md_doc_user_guide_modules_serial documentation.
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_API_GROUP_NORDIC Nordic-specific features
 * Mesh features specific to Nordic Semiconductor's nRF5 SDK for Mesh.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup MESH_OPT Mesh options API
 * Provides a consistent top-level API for runtime configuration options.
 *
 * Options are stored persistently.
 *
 * @warning This API must be called in the same IRQ priority as the one used by the mesh stack
 * (see @ref md_doc_user_guide_mesh_interrupt_priorities).
 *
