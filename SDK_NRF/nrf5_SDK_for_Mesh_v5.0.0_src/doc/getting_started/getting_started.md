# Getting started

The nRF SDK for Mesh provides you with tools and instructions that allow you to start developing
your own applications and use the Bluetooth mesh features.

To get started using the SDK, see @subpage md_doc_getting_started_mesh_quick_start.

You can then configure the required software toolchains and the process of building a Bluetooth mesh stack:
- @subpage md_doc_getting_started_how_to_toolchain
- @subpage md_doc_getting_started_how_to_build
- @subpage md_doc_getting_started_how_to_run_examples

@note
If you used one of the previous versions of the nRF SDK for Mesh,
check the @subpage md_MIGRATION_GUIDE.

## What to do next @anchor after_setup

Once you install the toolchain and you are familiar with the building process,
you can start using the nRF SDK for Mesh to the full extent:
- See @ref md_doc_user_guide_user_guide_main for information about available modules and components
and how to configure them.
- See @ref md_examples_README to start using the nRF5 SDK for Mesh example applications.
    - Make sure to take a look at the @ref md_examples_light_switch_README. It shows how a simple
    application can use the Bluetooth mesh stack and serves as an introduction to the Bluetooth mesh concepts
    and SDK features and APIs.
- @link_APIref contains the complete Bluetooth mesh stack API documentation.
- @link_Structref lists data structures and data fields used by the APIs.
