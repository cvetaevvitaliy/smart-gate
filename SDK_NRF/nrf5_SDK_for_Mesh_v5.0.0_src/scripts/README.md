# Serial interface

The Serial module provides full serialization of the mesh API, allowing other devices to control
the nRF5 mesh device through a UART interface. It is intended for complex applications,
for example network gateways and other devices that can enable users to control the mesh
from external technologies like cloud.

Read the following pages to learn more about the serial interface in the nRF SDK for Mesh:

* @subpage md_doc_user_guide_modules_serial - for detailed information about format, commands, events,
and status codes. 
* @subpage md_scripts_interactive_pyaci_README - for information about communicating with a device
running the serial interface, including tutorials for Loopback, Sending mesh packets,
and Interactive mesh provisioning and configuration.
